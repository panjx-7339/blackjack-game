# Blackjack Game 

Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This is a simple console-based Blackjack game written in Python, compatible on Windows and MacOS. 

## How to Play 

The goal of Blackjack is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

To start the game, run the `main.py` file from your terminal. Type 'y' to start the game, and you will be dealt two random cards. You will be asked if you wish to hit (draw another card), or stand (keep your current hand). Psst, if you have a 10 and Ace in your hand, you win -- it's a Blackjack!

Once you stand, the dealer will reveal the hand. The winner will be determined by comparing the player's and dealer's points. 

Here are other rules:
- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1. If the number of points is is over 21 but the player has an Ace, the Ace will be counted as 1.
